This project will utilize the visual capabilities of the Android mobile phone to extract
information from an image and translate it to another language. As further extensions, we would
like to use this information to run Google translator which translates the provided relevant
information. This application helps anyone travelling to a country that he doesnâ€™t know its
language to quickly and easily understand the meaning of the unknown words.
Extracting information from the captured image would require accurate recognition of the text in
order to run Google translator. The captured image would be subject to several environmental
conditions, such as lighting, reflection, rotation, scaling (we would desire the same data to be
extracted from capture image regardless of the distance from the camera), among others. The
project will be implemented using Java technologies for Android platform.
